We examine these framing activities across a diverse set of actors and assess the role of ideological, contextual, attributional and temporal factors hypothesized to account for the observed variation. The data come from a content analysis of articles on the French riots that appeared in newspapers from a half dozen countries during the period in which the riots occurred. Our findings, based primarily on variance and regression analyses, reveal varied support for our hypotheses, suggest the theoretical and analytical utility of examining frame variation beyond the French riots, and raise questions that call for further empirical inquiry regarding framing processes.},

Precise images and measures of network structure are derived from reports of relationships that occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995. The study offers a comparison of the structural characteristics of the observed network to simulated networks conditioned on the distribution of ties; the observed structure reveals networks characterized by longer contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with structural features similar to the observed network. Implications for disease transmission dynamics and social policy are explored.},

abstract = {This study represents the first systematic analysis of the interactions between pro-Zapatista and counter-Zapatista protestors in Chiapas, Mexico, and the first empirical test of movement-countermovement theories in a transitional democracy. Three claims are tested: (1) movement protests trigger countermovement protest activity; (2) different political parties at different levels of government trigger movement-countermovement protest activity; and (3) victories won by one side of a conflict, viewed as procedural concessions, trigger further pro- and countermovement protest activity. These hypotheses are tested using negative binomial models and data on Zapatista-related protest activity between 1994 and 2003. The results show that: (1) movement and countermovement protests have a positive, reciprocal effect on both groups' future protest activity; (2) movement and countermovement protesting groups use the dominant political party as a target of protest. The characteristics of the electoral cycle and rise of multi-party competition at all levels of government do not have a consistent effect on protest activity; (3) granting procedural concessions to pro-movement actors generates more protest activity among both groups. However, granting procedural concessions via social programs and public works to the population irrespective of its sympathy to either side of the movement-countermovement conflict decreases movement protests and increases countermovement protests.},

@article{einwohner_2006,
abstract = {Research on social movements has found that activists often deploy their identity strategically, putting forth certain images of themselves in order to best achieve their goals. However, such work has focused mostly on set- tings in which activists are relatively free to pursue different identity-based strategies. In contrast, less is known about the strategic use of identity in more repressive contexts, where the expression of certain identities may be curtailed. This paper addresses this issue by examining the “identity work” of Jewish resistance fighters in Nazi- occupied Warsaw, Poland. While their resistance was fueled by a strong sense of collective identity, the heavy costs associated with public displays of Jewishness meant that identity also had to be kept hidden in order for the resistance to occur. Unlike the freely chosen, “harmonic” identity work that has been described by most research, these activists’ work was forced and more dissonant, characterized by the simultaneous amplification and sup- pression of identity and emotion. The analysis points to the need for additional studies of activism in high-risk, repressive settings},

abstract = {AIM: To examine the associations between frequency of cannabis use and psychosocial outcomes in adolescence/young adulthood. DESIGN: A 21-year longitudinal study of the health, development and adjustment of a birth cohort of 1265 New Zealand children. MEASUREMENTS: Annual assessments of the frequency of cannabis use were obtained for the period from age 14-21 years, together with measures of psychosocial outcomes including property/violent crime, depression, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and other illicit drug use. FINDINGS: The frequency of cannabis use was associated significantly with all outcomes, and particularly other illicit drug use. Statistical control for confounding by both fixed and time-dynamic factors substantially reduced the strength of association between cannabis use and outcome measures. Nevertheless, cannabis use remained significantly (P < 0.05) associated with all outcomes and particularly other illicit drug use, after adjustment for confounding. For the measures of crime, suicidal behaviours and other illicit drug use there was evidence of age related variation in the strength of association with cannabis use, with younger (14-15 years old) users being more affected by regular cannabis use than older (20-21 years old) regular users. However, the association between cannabis use and depression did not vary with age. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis use, and particularly regular or heavy use, was associated with increased rates of a range of adjustment problems in adolescence/ young adulthood-other illicit drug use, crime, depression and suicidal behaviours-with these adverse effects being most evident for school-aged regular users. The findings reinforce public health concerns about minimizing the use of cannabis among school-aged populations.},

abstract = {Increasingly, scholars have come to see the news media as playing a pivotal role in shaping whether social movements are able to bring about broader social change. By drawing attention to movements’ issues, claims, and supporters, the news media can shape the public agenda by influencing public opinion, authorities, and elites. Why are some social movement organizations more successful than others at gaining media coverage? Specifically, what organizational, tactical, and issue characteristics enhance media attention? We combine detailed organizational survey data from a representative sample of 187 local environmental organizations in North Carolina with complete news coverage of those organizations in 11 major daily newspapers in the two years following the survey (2,095 articles). Our analyses reveal that local news media favor professional and formalized groups that employ routine advocacy tactics, mobilize large numbers of people, and work on issues that overlap with newspapers’ focus on local economic growth and well-being. Groups that are confrontational, volunteer-led, or advocate on behalf of novel issues do not garner as much attention in local media outlets. These findings have important implications and challenge widely held claims about the pathways by which movement actors shape the public agenda through the news media.},

By launching an important two-way interchange between earlier and subsequent waves of democratization, the books address three core questions: what prompts democratic openings; who are the most important actors in the push for democratization; and once undertaken, how is democracy secured. The four works offer different and at times competing answers to these questions, but all suggest that democracy's first wave was neither exceptional nor inevitable. Instead, it was marked by its own share of concessions and uncertainties, indicating the enduring relevance of Europe's democratization for contemporary cases.},

This work investigates a rarely studied mobilization of U.S. women in the first half of the 20th century to explore how movement organizations bring about legal change. Archival data for 15 states are examined to investigate how women won the right to sit on juries. The authors argue that jury movement activists engaged in strategic adaptation were more likely to win a change in jury laws rapidly. Those not engaged in such strategic action won their reforms more slowly. The authors suggest that when social movement actors tailor their actions to respond to exigencies in the environment they are more likely to expedite political success.

abstract = {Tables The much-discussed crisis of the welfare state is now two decades old. The tremendous twentieth-century expansion of social programs has been a remarkable feature of advanced industrial societies. In all these countries the welfare state is a core institution, accounting for between one-fifth and one-third of GNP. Ever since the postwar economic boom ended in the early 1970s, however, social programs have faced mounting political challenges. Questions of expansion have long since given way to an acknowledgment of the limits to welfare state growth and the prospect for extended austerity. Despite this fundamental change, however, we still know stunningly little about the politics of social policy retrenchment. In contrast to our vast knowledge of the dynamics of welfare state expansion--arguably the most well-tilled subfield of comparative public policy--welfare state retrenchment remains largely uncharted terrain. 1 Theoretically informed discussion has been limited to very abstract commentaries or the rather reflexive, often implicit application of propositions derived from the study of social policy expansion. This puzzling state of affairs results in part from the very success of earlier scholarship. The quality of historical research on the welfare state has encouraged a simple process of borrowing already developed models for the examination of a new environment. I would argue, however, that there are compelling reasons to reject such a straightforward extrapolation, that the new politics of the welfare state is instead quite different from the old. Welfare state expansion involved the enactment of popular policies in a relatively undeveloped interest-group environment. By contrast, welfare state retrenchment generally requires elected [End Page 143] officials to pursue unpopular policies that must withstand the scrutiny of both voters and well-entrenched networks of interest groups. It is therefore not surprising that variables crucial to understanding the former process are of limited use for analyzing the latter one. This essay seeks to lay the foundations for an analysis of welfare state retrenchment. I emphasize the critical constraints on reform resulting from the role of supportive interest groups and, ultimately, voters.},

Mainstream comparative research has neglected gender, while most feminist research on the welfare state has not been systematically comparative. I develop a conceptual framework for analyzing the gender content of so- cial provision that draws on feminist and mainstream work. Three dimensions of qualita- tive variation suggested by power resources analysts are reconstructed to incorporate gender: (1) the state-market relations dimension is extended to consider the ways coun- tries organize the provision of welfare through families as well as through states and markets; it is then termed the state-market-family relations dimension; (2) the stratifica- tion dimension is expanded to consider the effects of social provision by the state on gender relations, especially the treatment of paid and unpaid labor; (3) the social citi- zenship rights/decommodification dimension is criticizedfor implicit assumptions about the sexual division of caring and domestic labor and for ignoring the differential effects on men and women of benefits that decommodify labor Two additional dimensions are proposed to capture the effects of state social provision on gender relations: access to paid work and capacity to form and maintain an autonomous household},

This paper applies identity theory to the phenomenon of gender differences in distress among parents. From an identity perspective, I propose that salience of the parental identity in women's self-conceptions contributes to their vulnerability to parental role strains. Using 1988 survey data from a stratified random sample of married and divorced Indianapolis residents (N = 448), I find that gender differences in distress are explained by differences in exposure to parental role strains. Further analyses reveal, however, that salience of the parental identity contributes to both men's and women's vulnerability to parental role strains. These findings underscore the utility of identity theory for explaining psychological distress among women and men.},

A "movement infrastructure" model is developed that focuses on organizational structure, re- sources, and leadership to account for the impact of social movements on policy implementation. A two-tiered research design is employed that includes (1) a quanti- tative analysis of poverty programs in Mississippi counties from 1965 to 1971, and (2) case studies that show the complex interaction between the civil rights move- ment, resistance by whites, local powerholders, and federal agencies. The quantita- tive analysis shows that counties with strong movement infrastructures generated greater funding for Community Action Programs. The case studies show that move- ments were excluded from the initial formation of these programs as local whites attempted to preempt civil rights activists. However, in counties with strong move- ment infrastructures, activists were able to gain access to decision-making bodies and shape the content of poverty programs.},

Next we elaborate a "political mediation" theory of movement success. This theory holds that to be successful a movement organization must do more than just mobilize sup- porters and engage in collective action-political conditions must also be favorable to winning new advantages. We then examine historical information about national policymaking in Franktin Roosevelt's New Deal and quantitative data on spending by the Works Progress Administration. To assess the influence of Share Our Wealth, we analyze a secret polt undertaken by the Roosevelt Administration. The historical and quantitative analyses indicate that Share Our Wealth achieved partial success in ways that support the political mediation theory.},

abstract = {Cannabis is the most commonly used illegal drug, and numerous studies of cannabis users have been carried out in biomedical and epidemiological disciplines. However, surprisingly few researchers from sociology or other social science disciplines have investigated cannabis use in recent years. During its introduction phase in the 1960s, cannabis use was associated with a so-called 'hang-loose ethic', subversive political values and particular music preferences. In this article I ask whether this continues to be the case. I look for associations that indicate social marginalization and I analyse data from a longitudinal study of the Norwegian population in which a sample was followed from their early teens (in 1992) until their late 20s (in 2005). The results show that the recruitment base for cannabis use during adolescence had much in common with cannabis use in the 1960s. Music preferences such as hip-hop and heavy metal and subversive political attitudes were robust predictors of adolescent initiation into cannabis use. Indicators of parental social marginalization played no role. Conversely, a high level of parental education was positively associated with cannabis initiation. However, when the sample entered their 20s, cannabis users were increasingly located at the margins of society and characterized by poor education, unemployment and low levels of income.

Drawing upon evidence from Glasgow and Bristol, the authors identify a polycentric model of civic coordination based on horizontal solidarity, in which associations form dense clusters of strong identity ties (“social bonds”) bridged by fewer instrumental ties (“transactions”). Basic relational mechanisms, consistent across localities, provide the basis for both micro and macro integration: they generate networks tight enough to embed civic associations in a distinctive environment, but open enough to connect them to a broader range of civic organizations. While contributing primarily to the understanding of political networks, the authors' findings also have implications for current debates on associational social capital and the impact of political contexts on the structure of collective action.},

As for the conditions under which movements matter, scholars have been revising their initial hypotheses that the strategies, organizational forms, and political contexts that aid mobilization also aid in gaining and exerting political influence. Scholars are exploring alternative arguments about the productivity of different actions and characteristics of movements and movement organizations in the varied political contexts and institutional settings they face. Researchers are also employing more innovative research designs to appraise these more complex arguments. Scholarship will advance best if scholars continue to think through the interactions between strategies, organizations, and contexts; address movement influences on processes in institutional politics beyond the agenda-setting stage; situate case studies in comparative and historical perspective; and make more comparisons across movements and issues.},

We use sequential logistic regression to assess the effects of explanatory variables on two intermediate stages of mobilization and policy change. In the case of challengers, we estimate the likelihood a state-level organization is present in any given legislative year. In the case of state actors, we estimate the likelihood a bill passes one legislative house given the presence of a state-level suffrage organization and that a bill has been introduced. Mixed signals are apparent in that challengers and legislators respond to the same environmental factors differently. Challengers respond to perceived opportunities for change. Legislators seek to enhance their political careers and are responsive to the demands of challengers when they perceive challengers as politically powerful or when social and cultural change signals a demand for policy reform. Legislators, in the end, are much more conservative in their response to the political context. Adapted from the source document.},

abstract = {Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) appears to offer a systematic means for case-oriented analysis. The method not only offers to provide a standard- ized procedure for qualitative research but also serves, to some, as an instan- tiation of deterministic methods. Others, however, contest QCA because of its deterministic lineage. Multiple other issues surrounding QCA, such as its response to measurement error and its ability to ascertain asymmetric caus- ality, are also matters of interest. Existing research has demonstrated the use of QCA on real data, but such data do not allow one to establish the meth- od’s efficacy, because the true causes of real social phenomena are always contestable. In response, the authors analyze several simulated data sets for which true causal processes are known. They find that QCA finds the correct causal story only 3 times across 70 different solutions, and even these rare successes, on closer examination, actually reveal additional fundamental problems with the method. Further epistemological analyses of the results find key problems with QCA’s stated epistemology, and results indicate that QCA fails even when its stated epistemological claims are ontologically accurate. Thus, the authors conclude that analysts should reject both QCA and its epistemological justifications in favor of existing effective methods and epistemologies for qualitative research.},

abstract = {This article investigates the empirical evidence for the statement that the impact of social movement organizations (SMOs) and interest groups on policy making is dependent on public opinion and the political system. A meta-analysis of articles published in eleven sociology and political science journals from 1990 to 2007 is used to test two hypotheses: 1) when public opinion is taken into account, SMOs and interest groups have no direct effect on policy; 2) the existence of a democratic regime is a necessary precondition for finding any policy impact of SMOs and interest groups. Results show that taking account of public opinion does not generally make any difference in the finding of direct effects. However, the role of public opinion varies across the measures of organizational resources and activity. I also find that a democratic regime is not a necessary precondition for the impact of SMOs and interest groups on public policy, but show that a direct effect of interest organizations is less likely to be found in the studies that take account of political regime.},

@article{mcadam_1983,
abstract = {The pace of black insurgency between 1955 and 1970 is analyzed as a function of an ongoing process of tactical interaction between movement forces and southern segregationists. Given a political system vulnerable to challenge and strong internal organization the main challenge confronting insurgents is a preeminently tactical one. Lacking institutionalized power, challengers must devise protest techniques that offset their powerlessness. This is referred to as a process of tactical innovation. Such innovations, however, only temporarily afford challengers increased bargaining leverage. In chess-like fashion, movement opponents can be expected, through effective tactical adaptation, to neutralize the new tactic, thereby reinstituting the power disparity between themselves and the challenger. This perspective is applied to the development of the black movement over the period, 1955-1970. Evidence derived from content-coding all relevant story synopses contained in The New York Times Index for these years is presented showing a strong correspondence between the introduction of new protest techniques and peaks in movement activity. Conversely, lulls in black insurgency reflect the successful efforts of movement opponents to devise effective tactical counters to these innovations.},

It reconceptualizes the relationship between social breakdown and movement emergence in a fashion that is consistent with strands of cultural theory, phenomenology, and symbolic interactionism, and that resonates with prospect theory and research on collective action in a diversity of settings. It argues that the key to the breakdown-movement relationship resides in the actual or threatened disruption of the "quotidian"—that is, the taken-for-granted routines and attitudes of everyday life. Four conditions are especially likely to disrupt the quotidian and heighten prospects of collective action: accidents that throw a community's routines into doubt and/or threaten its existence; actual or threatened intrusion into and/or violation of citizens' sense of privacy, safety, and control; alteration in subsistence routines because unfavorable ratios of resources to claimants or demand; and dramatic changes in structures of social control. The relationship between these conditions and movement emergence is elaborated by drawing on literature on the emergence of collective action in various contexts and on our field work on homeless mobilization in eight cities. We close by exploring the implications of our analysis for understanding more fully the generality of various conditions and processes commonly thought to apply to social movement emergence.},

This paper analyzes organizational case histories from the pro-choice (abortion rights) movement to explore the consequences of professional leadership and formal structure in social movements. Five general propositions are drawn from the case of the pro-choice movement: (1) professional movement activists do not initiate movements and create new tactics; the roles of movement "professional" and movement "entrepreneur" are distinct; (2)professional movement leaders tend to formalize the organizations they lead; (3) formalized social movement organizations (SMOs) help maintain social movements when environmental conditions make mobilization dificult; (4) professional leaders and formalized SMOs stimulate the use of institutionalized tactics; and (5)professionalization and formalization facilitate coalition work.

Political parties organize politics in every modern democracy, and some observers claim that parties are what induce democracies to be responsive. Yet, according to others, parties give voice to extremists and reduce the responsiveness of governments to the citizenry. The debate about parties and democracy takes on renewed importance as new democracies around the globe struggle with issues of representation and governability. I show that our view of the impact of parties on democratic responsiveness hinges on what parties are—their objectives and organization. I review competing theories of parties, sketch their testable implications, and note the empirical findings that may help adjudicate among these theories. I also review debates about the origins of parties, about the determinants of party-system size and characteristics, and about party competition.},

abstract = {This article draws upon 134 in-depth interviews with activists and journalists in an effort to reconcile the extensive activism taking place in the shadows of presidential campaigns with its near invisibility in the news. In his classic work, Todd Gitlin (1980) demonstrated that activists become newsworthy only by submitting to the “implicit rules of news making” (p. 3). This research supports his finding, but demonstrates that unbeknownst to activists, coverage of political outsiders is governed by a set of rules quite different from (and often diametrically opposed to) those employed in routine news-gathering. Taking cues from news creation practices that go on daily between journalists, parajournalists, and subjects, activist groups work assiduously to prepare members to fit the needs of political reporters. They bend over backwards to be media-friendly, which they perceive as professional, quotable, and credible, but ironically these studied attempts to conform to the norms of routine political reporting make them less appealing to journalists. While journalists may attend eagerly to elected officials’ press confer- ences and official statements, they demand authenticity, particularly in the form of emotion and spontaneity, from outsiders—the very attributes activists work to erase in their media trainings. In the end, the activist groups fail to obtain coverage, not because they can’t conform to the rules of news making, but because they are following the wrong rules. This article maps the contradictory sets of norms at play in the negotiation over news, and shows how they work together to create nearly insurmountable cultural boundaries for political outsiders.

Various competing hypotheses concerning the factors related to depression are explored using interview data from a study of psychological distress in a representative sample of adults in a midwestern community (N = 1,026). Although women reported more distress than men, the largest difference among married people was between employed married men \& housewives. Employed married women experienced slightly less distress than housewives, but having minor children in the household was especially stressful for these women \& counteracted the advantage of employment. The effects of children in the household on distress were strongest among working women with lower family incomes, supporting the hypothesis that the strain of working \& doing the majority of the work associated with raising children increases women's distress. 4 Tables.

abstract = {This article contributes to a more systematic understanding of movement outcomes by analyzing how organizational, tactical, political, and framing variables interact and combine to account for differences in the outcomes attained by 15 homeless social movement organizations (SMOs) active in eight U.S. cities. Using qualitative comparative analysis to assess ethnographically derived data on the 15 SMOs, the study highlights the importance of organizational viability and the rhetorical quality of diagnostic and prognostic frames for securing outcomes while identifying a contingent relationship between tactics and political environment. The analysis suggests that there are multiple pathways leading to movement outcomes attainment, and therefore unidimentional rather than combinatorial and interactive approaches are misguided.},

Using both descriptive and inferential statistics, the author demonstrates a strong effect of participation on the subsequent lives of the volunteers and "no-shows." The volunteers were more politically active throughout the sixties than the no-shows and remain so today. In addition, the volunteers are much less likely to be married and to have significantly lower incomes at present than are the no-shows. Besides reporting these basic findings, the author seeks through path analysis to explore the specific factors and processes that mediate the impact of participation in Freedom Summer on the later lives of the volunteers.

abstract = {During the 1980s, homeless people formed social movement organizations and mobilized collective action events in cities across the U.S. From the vantage point of social movement theories and scholarship on homelessness, it is surprising that homeless protest was so prevalent in the 1980s. Yet we find evidence of homeless protest events across no fewer than 50 U.S. cities in the 1980-90 period. Drawing on social movement theories about the precipitants of mobilization, we examine the extent to which city-level contextual factors, and their change over time, affect variation in the frequency of homeless mobilization across 17 of these cities. Our findings reveal that a mix offactors congruent with strain and resource mobilization theories helps to account for variation in the frequency of homeless protest across U.S. cities in the 1980s},

abstract = {This study examines how ideologically opposed social movement organizations, the National Organization for Women (NOW) and Concerned Women for America (CWA), get media coverage during critical moments of the abortion debate. I analyze how organizational structure and identity facilitate or constrain a social movement organization's ability to get mainstream media coverage. Specifically, I use the social movement framing literature to analyze how the organizations strategically construct media frames and packages in response to opposition, the tactics they use to get media coverage, and the relative success of each organization's efforts in mass media outlets. The analysis suggests that an organization's media strategy matters, but that organizational structure and organizational identity color these strategies. One of the best ways to develop press relations is to know how a particular newspaper or broadcast station operates. Make friends with reporters or newscasters who are sympathetic to the issues. They can be strong allies. Remember, publicity means "information with news value" issued as a means of gaining public attention, recognition, understanding or support for a person, an organization, an institution or a cause. National Organization for Women Records (Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute at Harvard University) Conservative groups did not understand media or its importance then [ten years ago] as much as they do now. [Now they understand that] media is the name of the game and whoever frames the issue wins the argument.

abstract = {Contrary to the view of some academics that the family in America is not declining but just changing, the thesis of this article is that family decline since 1960 has been extraordinarily steep, and its social consequences serious, especially for children. Drawing mainly on U.S. Census data, family trends of the past 3 decades are reviewed. The evidence for family decline is appraised in 3 areas: demographic, institutional, and cultural. It is argued that families have lost functions, power, and authority, that familism as a cultural value has diminished, and that people have become less willing to invest time, money and energy in family life, turning instead to investments in themselves. It is concluded that this recent family decline is more serious than any decline in the past because what is breaking up is the nuclear family, the fundamental unit stripped of relatives and left with 2 essential functions that cannot be performed better elsewhere: childrearing and the provision to its members of affection and companionship.},

abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed a double movement within the field of crime control characterized by the prison boom and intensive policing, on the one hand, and widespread implementation of new approaches that assign policing responsibilities to non-police actors, on the other. The latter development has been accomplished by expansion of third-party policing policies; nuisance property ordinances, which sanction landlords for their tenants' behavior, are among the most popular. This study, an analysis of every nuisance citation distributed in Milwaukee over a two-year period, is among the first to evaluate empirically the impact of coercive third-party policing on the urban poor. Properties in black neighborhoods disproportionately received citations, and those located in more integrated black neighborhoods had the highest likelihood of being deemed nuisances. Nearly a third of all citations were generated by domestic violence; most property owners abated this "nuisance" by evicting battered women. Landlords also took steps to discourage tenants from calling 911; overrepresented among callers, women were disproportionately affected by these measures. By looking beyond traditional policing, this study reveals previously unforeseen consequences of new crime control strategies for women from inner-city neighborhoods. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This paper explores their relation- ship by analyzing the discourse on nuclear power in four general audience media: television news coverage, newsmagazine accounts, editorial cartoons, and syndicated opinion columns. The analysis traces the careers of different interpretive packages on nuclear power from 1945 to the present. This media discourse, it is argued, is an essential context for understanding the formation of public opinion on nuclear power. More specifically, it helps to account for such survey results as the decline in support for nuclear power before Three Mile Island, a rebound after a burst of media publicity has died out, the gap between general support for nuclear power and support for a plant in one's own community, and the changed relationship of age to support for nuclear power from 1950 to the present.

Moderately large-n studies are interesting in this respect since they allow for regression analysis as well as fsQCA analysis. These two approaches have a different epistemological foundation and thereby answer different, yet related, research questions. To illustrate the comparison of fsQCA and regression analysis empirically, I use a recent data set (n = 53) that includes data on the conditions under which governments in Western democracies increase their spending on active labor market policies (ALMPs). This comparison demonstrates that while each approach has merits and demerits, fsQCA leads to a fuller understanding of the conditions under which the outcome occurs.},

abstract = {Similarity breeds connection. This principle—the homophily princi- ple—structures network ties of every type, including marriage, friendship, work, advice, support, information transfer, exchange, comembership, and other types of re- lationship. The result is that people’s personal networks are homogeneous with regard to many sociodemographic, behavioral, and intrapersonal characteristics. Homophily limits people’s social worlds in a way that has powerful implications for the infor- mation they receive, the attitudes they form, and the interactions they experience. Homophily in race and ethnicity creates the strongest divides in our personal envi- ronments, with age, religion, education, occupation, and gender following in roughly that order. Geographic propinquity, families, organizations, and isomorphic positions in social systems all create contexts in which homophilous relations form. Ties be- tween nonsimilar individuals also dissolve at a higher rate, which sets the stage for the formation of niches (localized positions) within social space. We argue for more research on: (a) the basic ecological processes that link organizations, associations, cultural communities, social movements, and many other social forms; (b) the impact of multiplex ties on the patterns of homophily; and (c) the dynamics of network change over time through which networks and other social entities co-evolve.},

Why did some states pass such fair employment practice (FEP) laws much more slowly than other states? This article presents archival and statistical evidence that partisan control of policy-making institutions— namely, Republican control of “veto points” in the legislative pro- cess—is associated with a substantial reduction in the likelihood that a state would pass FEP legislation, even when controlling for potentially confounding variables. This finding casts doubt on the leading account of the electoral realignment that began in the mid- 1960s and culminated in the Reagan-Bush years. Well before the advent of affirmative action, key numbers of GOP officeholders— allied with organized business and motivated by a free-market, an- tiregulatory ideology—worked successfully to block the adoption of color-blind laws mandating formal racial equality.},

Economic hardship, in turn, increases both spouses' depression levels. Other factors affect husbands and wives differently. A husband's personal earnings directly decrease his depression, because, we argue, his earnings indicate successful fulfillment of provider obligations.

abstract = {Summary. Neighbourhood characteristics affect the social and economic opportunities of their residents. Although various studies have analysed housing adjustments at different life stages, little is known about neighbourhood quality adjustments, or movements into ‘better’ or ‘worse’ neighbourhoods. On the basis of a model of optimal housing consumption we analyse the determinants of residential mobility and the associated neighbourhood quality adjustments, drawing on data from the British Household Panel Survey and indices of multiple deprivation. We measure quality of neighbourhood both subjectively and objectively and find that not all life course events that are associated with moves lead to neighbourhood quality adjustments. Single people are negatively affected when ceasing to live with parents and couples by a husband's unemployment. Couples having a new baby move into better neighbourhoods.},

Using the Plowshares movement as a case study, this article addresses the question of how long- term activist commitment is cultivated and sustained in a high-risk movement. Based on participant observation, in-depth interviews and survey data, I conclude that this movement has survived because leaders formed com- munities that function as plausibility structures. Through various rituals and cultural practices, these Catholic Left communities reinforce activist identity and strengthen members’ normative, affective, and continuance com- mitment. Moreover, leaders implement strategies for countering the factors that foster movement exiting— namely, biographical unavailability, burnout, and weakening of ties to activist networks. By offering material and emotional support, and assistance with family responsibilities, these communities help activists overcome the barriers to long-term movement participation.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This survey study explores the relationship between area-specific perceived self-competence, perceived social support, gender, and substance use in young adolescents. METHOD: Questionnaires were administered to 140 male and 131 female adolescents attending middle school to assess self-perception of competencies, social support, and substance use. Correlations were performed between the predictor variables and the substance use measures. Hierarchical multiple regressions were also used to identify potential interactions between gender, perceived competencies, and perceived social support in the prediction of specific substances. RESULTS: Higher perceived scholastic competence was associated with less substance use in both genders. In boys, more perceived support from teachers, and to a lesser degree parents, was associated with less substance use, particularly in those with low scholastic competence. In girls, social support was unrelated to substance use except for support from classmates, which was associated with more cigarette and marijuana use. However, in girls with low scholastic competence, more support from peers was consistently associated with more substance use. CONCLUSIONS: The gender differences in risk factors for early substance use identified in this study deserve further investigation, in view of their potential relevance for adolescent substance abuse prevention and early intervention.},

Previous studies, often based on aggregated data on public protests, focus on the effects of elections on established social movement organizations (SMOs). Some find that SMOs flourish during election years, taking advantage of the political opportunities that elections pose. Others conclude that elections hurt SMOs, siphoning members and resources. Using ethnographic, in-depth interview, and document data on newand emerging socialmovement groups (SMGs) in Pittsburgh for 20 months before and after the 2004 U.S. presidential election, we examine how members think about elections and whether and how groups decide to respond to national electoral campaigns. We find that SMGs vary considerably in the strategies of action or inaction they adopt, depending on their changing sense of whether the election poses an opportunity or a threat to the group and that these strategies of action are patterned in path-dependent sequences. We conclude with a discussion of the possibilities for integrating concepts of path-dependency and timing into social movement research.},

Third, I test two models of the diffusion of rioting. Like previous analyses, my findings fail to support structural strain theories. Contrary to previous analyses however, the size of the non-White population is not the singular predictor found for the 1960s' riot locations.

abstract = {There are two main ways of distinguishing parties from other techniques for pursuing political objectives: institutional definitions emphasize the arena in which collective political action takes place; functional definitions see parties as political alliances for solving problems of collective action and social choice. Kitschelt here combines the two approaches, asking, what are the institutional conditions under which the functional criteria for constituting a political party are met? Different institutional conditions result in different types of political parties: those with a programmed that offer credible policy initiatives and clientalist parties that offer a direct exchange of goods for votes. In Europe, programmatic parties prevail and political sociologists have focused on their relation to social divides and cleavages. Another -oddly unrelated -field of investigation is that of party competition, primarily studied from a rational choice theory perspective. The study of party organization is rather under-developed -there has been a tendency to treat parties as unitary actors; the existing literature in political sociology is largely inspired by Michels's early work on party oligarchy. However, new controversies have been generated by debates over the precise form parties now take in post-industrial democracies. In the final section Kitschelt outlines two main alternative developments for political parties: the technocratic-monological model in which existing parties maintain their dominance aided by professional advice; and the postmodern pluralist interpretation which sees the potential for a proliferation of new parties appealing to an increasingly sophisticated and differentiated electorate. Interest groups, social movements, and political parties are specific techniques individuals choose to pursue political objectives by pooling resources. People's goals are political when they seek authoritative decisions that are ultimately backed up by coercion in order to (re)distribute material or non-material life chances, rights and privileges. Whether political pursuits take the form of a political party hinges upon institutional or functional attributes that},

This type of analysis is perfectly justifiable if the goal is to test deterministic hypotheses under the assumption of error-free measures of the employed variables. My contention is, however, that only in a very few research areas are our theories sufficiently advanced to yield deterministic hypotheses. Also, given the nature of our objects of study, error-free measures are largely an illusion. Hence, it is unsurprising that many studies employ QCA inductively and gloss over possible measurement errors. In this article, I address these issues and demonstrate the consequences of these problems with simple empirical examples. In an analysis similar to Monte Carlo simulation, I show that using Boolean algebra in an exploratory fashion without considering possible meas- urement errors may lead to dramatically misleading inferences.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine the joint influences of parental monitoring and peer influence on adolescent substance use over time. SUBJECTS: 6500 adolescents attending six high schools in Wisconsin and northern California. DESIGN: Longitudinal study. RESULTS: Parental monitoring was negatively associated with substance use, whereas the more involved an adolescent's peers were in substance use, the more likely he or she also was to use drugs and alcohol. Effects of monitoring and peer coercion were strongest for boys and girls at the transition into substance use, rather than at the transition from experimentation to regular use. The effect of parental monitoring on changes in adolescent substance use is mediated not so much by the nature of the adolescent's peer associates, but by its direct effect on the adolescent. Specifically, poorly monitored adolescents are more likely to use drugs, and drug-using adolescents seek out like-minded friends. Once an adolescent associates with drug-using peers, his or her own substance use approaches their level. CONCLUSIONS: Intervention effects should include both parents and community-level efforts. Parental monitoring is an effective tool both in the prevention of drug use and in the amelioration of drug use.},

abstract = {"The antiwar movement’s extensive mobilization, comprising millions in the full range of movement activities well before the war started, and continuing, albeit in different forms and at lower levels, throughout the war and occupation, raises important questions about the relationship of social movements to political circumstances... Even as the politics of protest varied across contexts, the impending war provided a common focal point for diverse concerns. Although activist efforts to coordinate events transnationally are not new (e.g., Carter 1992; DeBennedetti 1980; Solo 1988; Wittner 1998), their degree of success was. Focusing on why, how, and under what circumstances activists chose to cooperate highlights key issues at the heart of understanding contemporary social movements. Here, we use the antiwar movement in the United States to examine the nature of social movement coalitions, outlining countervailing pressures on social movement groups to cooperate and to compete. We will argue that the nature of movement coalitions can be best understood by focusing on the external circumstances under which coalitions develop, and suggest that we can discern a pattern of coalition development and decline by looking at the political opportunities surrounding social movements. Taken together, we have a window into the coalition politics that characterize contemporary social movements in liberal polities, and an opportunity to examine cooperation and conflict over issues, goals, and tactics" (p. 328). "Although it is a grammatical convenience to speak about THE peace movement, THE anti-globalization movement, or THE environmental movement, such labels distort the reality of social movements, reifying boundaries and movements that are actually much sloppier affairs. This antiwar mobilization included groups ranging from the Christian pacifists to the International Socialist Organization, both of which offer far broader— and substantially different—agendas for reform than just stopping this war. Marchers at the peace demonstrations after the war began knew that they agreed with those next to them on one key issue. Social movements are always about more than their explicitly articulated claims, and many activists surely agreed on much else (della Porta and Rucht 1995; Meyer and Whittier 1994), but the full range of concerns is much broader, diverse, and contested than what can be gleaned from any one manifestation of activism. Social movements are comprised of organized groups and individuals cooperating, to some degree, on a set of common issues. Although the research mobilization tradition (e.g. McCarthy and Zald 1977) put social movement organizations at the center of analysis, relatively little work that explicitly considered the dynamics of social movement coalitions followed (but see Gerhards and Rucht 1992; McCammon 2001; McCammon and Campbell 2002; Zald and McCarthy 1987; Staggenborg 1986; Rochon and Meyer 1997; Van Dyke 2003). The growth of a political process approach (Tilly 1978; McAdam 1982; Tarrow 1998; Meyer 2004) generally turned attention toward events (Olzak 1989; Earl et al. 2004), rather than the organizations, activists, and processes that create them" (p. 329). "Recognition of the breadth of movement activism and concerns emphasizes the dynamic nature of social change efforts and social protest movements. Activists draw both grievances and resources from more mainstream sources. Further, they use extra-institutional or nonconventional protest as a lever to enhance the political efficacy of allies working within institutions, closer to the formal policymaking process. As they build inroads into political institutions, they alter the grievances, resources, and opportunities available to dissidents, including themselves. Because the different groups enter activism with distinct priorities and longer term goals, a movement’s interaction with mainstream politics affects the strength of coordination among its participating organizations. The attractions of protest or mainstream politics vary for each group, as will their commitment to the strongest movement of the moment. In this regard, it is important to point out that the extent of cooperation within a coalition will vary from coalition to coalition, and among cooperating groups within a coalition. Even when organized groups or their leaders agree on the general direction that policy should move, they may choose not to work together on affecting political mobilization or influence. The extent of cooperation varies over two dimensions, in degree and over time (Tarrow 2004)" (p. 329). "In making decisions about alliances and issues, a social movement organization operates in the service of at least three distinct, but interrelated goals: (1) to pressure government to affect the policy changes it wants; (2) to educate the public and persuade people of the urgency of the problems it addresses and the wisdom of its position; and (3) to sustain a flow of resources that allows it to maintain its existence and efforts (Zald and McCarthy 1987; Wilson 1995). What is useful for achieving one objective is not always helpful in working toward another. As example, the literature on lobbying (e.g. Berry 1999; Schlozman and Tierney 1986) suggests that moderation, credibility, and restraint are keys to influence on Capitol Hill. At the same time, those very qualities are anathema to maintaining a high public profile, and thus publicizing ideas, and may make sustaining a flow of resources for a citizen group more difficult. In contrast, a politics of polemic, characterized by dramatic action, may be very useful in maintaining a public profile, but the action may supersede the analysis (say, for example, a dramatic civil disobedience action, like those staged by Operation Rescue). While satisfying supporters, it may reach few others and can even mobilize the opposition (Meyer and Staggenborg 1996). In the case of groups with foreign policy concerns, transnational connections and alliances, which can heighten the visibility, volatility, and scope of a social movement, might also raise suspicion among policy-makers" (p. 330). "By cooperating with groups that may appeal to the same funders or member, an organization may obscure its own identity in service of a larger movement, diminishing its visibility in mass media (Rohlinger 2002) or its capacity to recruit members or raise funds. As with individuals, organizations cultivate distinct organizational identities that define them to both members and the outside world (Clemens 1993). Such identities encourage certain alliances, while forestalling others. Alliances can compromise identities, and can visibly associate organizations with unreliable or tainted allies. In addition, social ties and networks, significant factors in the participation of individuals in social movements, are also important predictors of cooperation among groups. In this way, a group will be more likely to cooperate with others with whom they have worked in the past or with whom they share common members (Van Dyke 2003). Each decision then is not independent, but rather is nested in a history of past decisions and existing relationships" (p. 331). "More generally, the coalition is a generic form that can include a broad variety of negotiated arrangements of two or more organizations coordinating goals, demands, strategies of influence, and events" (p. 331). "...there is relatively little work that explicitly considers the elements of the political environment that encourage or discourage cooperation among groups, and the dynamic nature of relationships among participating groups. External circumstances alter the costs and benefits of cooperation, to say nothing of the perceived urgency for collective action (Meyer 2004). Recently, a few scholars have directed attention to the contextual factors that affect the calculus of cooperation. McCammon and Campbell (2002), in an historical study of the suffrage movement, examine alliances between suffragettes and the Women’s Christian Temperance Union. They find that alliances are most likely to form in response to political threats, including mobilization and organization of the opposition (in this case, brewers’ associations) and the prospects of legislative defeats. Similarly, in a longitudinal study of student activism across a wide range of American campuses, Van Dyke (2003) finds that both proximate (campus-based) and national threats spurred cooperation among a broad range of student activist groups. This makes sense to us. We contend that coalition dynamics roughly approximate similar decisions that individuals make about participating in a social movement. Building on this insight, we can offer a theory of cooperation among social movement groups that follows the logic of social movement cycles (Tarrow 1989; Meyer and Imig 1993). Groups join coalition efforts when they see their efforts on a particular set of issues and efforts as urgent and potentially efficacious. Like individuals, most groups represent a range of political concerns, and external conditions play a substantial role in organizing their relative priorities. Following McCammon and Campbell (2002) and Van Dyke (2003), threats, defined as unwanted policy initiatives, are likely to spur cooperation. During favorable political circumstances, groups are likely to have less interest in cooperating with others. In other words, threats lead the urgency of cooperation to outweigh the inherent risks. When external circumstances change, altering either the perceived urgency or efficacy of mobilization, organizations return to their core concerns and activities. Importantly, groups generally don’t need to exit coalitions in order to refocus their own priorities and activities. Paper coalitions may continue, but the commitment to coordinated collective action dissipates, as does the extent of actual cooperation" (p. 332). "Win Without War is a co},

abstract = {In February 2009, the Tea Party Movement (TPM) burst onto the political scene in the USA. Emerging out of popular unrest over the economic downturn of 2008 and the perceived radical agenda of President Barack Obama, the Tea Party quickly captured the imagination of disenchanted conservatives. Media coverage of the movement was abundant, with a frame contest between the TPM and its political opponents swiftly surfacing. Media frames bracketed discussions over the authenticity of the Tea Party, the composition of its members, the movement's message, and whether the TPM was poised for a long-term impact. This study systematically analyzes the predominant media frames that materialized in 882 news packets from nine major print and television news sources between 19 February 2009 and 30 November 2010 in order to better understand the role the US media played in defining the Tea Party, and to determine whether Tea Party perceptions of its media coverage were accurate. Four sets of diametric frames appeared in the media-the Everyday American vs. Non-Mainstream, Grassroots vs. Establishment-Affiliated, Fiscal-Federal Frustrations vs. Amalgam of Grievances, and Election Impact vs. Flash in the Pan. Overall, the TPM succeeded in mobilizing symbolic media representations to advance their goals, achieving politically propitious coverage. US media depicted the TPM with supportive frames more than twice as often as the deprecatory characterizations the activists opposed. This study investigates how the media used these frames and discusses implications of Tea Party coverage as it relates to journalistic norms, social activism, and overarching framing processes.

This article fills the void by examining the dynamics and the impact of the month-long 2004 same-sex wedding protest in San Francisco. We integrate insights of contentious politics approaches with social constructionist conceptions and identify three core features of cultural repertoires: contestation, intentionality, and collective identity. Our analyses, which draw on rich qualitative and quantitative data from interviews with participants and movement leaders and a random survey of participants, highlight these dimensions of cultural repertoires as well as the impact that the same-sex wedding protest had on subsequent activism. Same-sex weddings, as our multimethod analyses show, were an intentional episode of claim-making, with participants arriving with a history of activism in a variety of other social movements. Moreover, relative to the question of impact, the initial protest sparked other forms of political action that ignited a statewide campaign for marriage equality in California. Our results offer powerful evidence that culture can be consequential not only internally, with implications for participant solidarity and identity, but for political change and further action as well. We conclude by discussing the specifics of our case and the broader implications for social movement scholars.},

abstract = {A combined case study of class relations, politics \& voting in Sweden, \& comparative analysis of distributive conflicts \& politics in 18 OECD countries; in 10 Chpts. The underlying theoretical theme is the development of class relations in free-enterprise societies. Chpt (1) Introduction: Class, Power and Social Change - reviews the various theoretical conceptualizations of the structural bases of conflict in Western societies, from Marx, through Weber, via Hobbes, Lenin, \& pluralist thought. Sweden is proposed as a test case for studying class relations \& conflicts of interest in advanced industrial nations, because of its long history of a strong, reformist socialist government. (2) The Democratic Class Struggle - critically discusses two approaches to understanding the development of advanced industrial societies; pluralist thought, based on the 'logic of industrialization', \& various conceptions of neo-corporatism. An approach based on class structure \& the distribution of power resources between classes is offered as an alternative. (3) Working Class Mobilization - views the development of unions \& leftist parties in 18 OECD countries, \& examines the development of class relations in Sweden. (4) Electorate Participation - discusses, against a background of international comparisons, how different groups in Sweden have become involved in the class struggle by using their vote. (5) Social Roots of Party Preferences - deals with the factors that determine voter preferences \& loyalties. Changes in the parties' support among different occupational groups \& classes, after WWII, are elucidated. (6) Electoral Geography - considers the fact that Swedish units of political decision-making are geographically delimited. Changes in 'red' \& 'blue' Sweden since the 1920s are traced; influences of the social environment on the socialist vote are examined; \& voters in metropolitan centers, a special case, are discussed. (7) Voters on the Move - uses these data to analyze the increasing volatility of the electorate. The possibility of a new dimension, involving environmental issues, etc, complementing the classic Left/Right conformation of Swedish politics is explored, using a referendum on nuclear power, in 1980, as a reference point. (8) The Politics of Industrial Conflict - compares the clashes between labor \& capital since the 1900s, in 18 OECD countries. The central theme is an analysis of the conditions under which the base of distributive conflicts can be switched from the labor market to politics. (9) Social Policy - questions the importance the political composition of the executive can have for social policy \& the development of the welfare state. A set of concepts is devised for analyzing cross-national variations in welfare-state development. Empirical data regarding the effects of politics on inequality in different countries are examined. (10) After the Historical Compromise - attempts to tie together the themes of the previous chpts. The direction of change in the ability of the labor movement to remold the foundations capitalist society is again addressed, in relation to the preceding discussions. Appendix, Notes, Bibliog},

abstract = {We examine Democrats' decline in the House of Representatives from the mid-1930s to the late 1940s. Debates over American exceptionalism in the realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home, the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show that World War II mobilization played an important role. First, Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered significantly greater losses where both non-white population and aircraft manufacturing employment increased. Our findings corroborate accounts of the social welfare state that stress partisan control and path dependence. Conservative congresses of the immediate postwar years left an imposing legacy, making it difficult to establish social welfare reforms for decades to come. Whereas most accounts of the rise and fall of the New Deal emphasize different aspects of domestic processes, we demonstrate that militarism and expansion of national security agencies undermined congressional support at a critical juncture. This intersection of wartime mobilization and social policy-and not an inherent and enduring institutional impediment to social welfare-contributed to under-development of the welfare state and abandonment of universal social welfare programs in the United States.},

And while such studies explain variation in aggregate homicide rates, they do not explain the social order of murder, that is, who kills whom, when, where, and for what reason. This article argues that gang murder is best understood not by searching for its individual determinants but by examining the social networks of action and reaction that create it. In short, the social structure of gang murder is defined by the manner in which social networks are constructed and by people's placement in them. The author uses a network approach and incident-level homicide records to recreate and analyze the structure of gang murders in Chicago. Findings demonstrate that individual murders between gangs create an institutionalized network of group conflict, net of any individual's participation or motive. Within this network, murders spread through an epidemic-like process of social contagion as gangs evaluate the highly visible actions of others in their local networks and negotiate dominance considerations that arise during violent incidents.},

In stark contrast to the central thrust of the social movement literature, the authors find that the overall level of emergent opposition to the projects to have been very low, and they seek to explain that variation and the impact, if any, it had on the ultimate fate of the proposed projects.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine how concurrent partnerships amplify the rate of HIV spread, using methods that can be supported by feasible data collection. METHODS: A fully stochastic simulation is used to represent a population of individuals, the sexual partnerships that they form and dissolve over time, and the spread of an infectious disease. Sequential monogamy is compared with various levels of concurrency, holding all other features of the infection process constant. Effective summary measures of concurrency are developed that can be estimated on the basis of simple local network data. RESULTS: Concurrent partnerships exponentially increase the number of infected individuals and the growth rate of the epidemic during its initial phase. For example, when one-half of the partnerships in a population are concurrent, the size of the epidemic after 5 years is 10 times as large as under sequential monogamy. The primary cause of this amplification is the growth in the number of people connected in the network at any point in time: the size of the largest "component'. Concurrency increases the size of this component, and the result is that the infectious agent is no longer trapped in a monogamous partnership after transmission occurs, but can spread immediately beyond this partnership to infect others. The summary measure of concurrency developed here does a good job in predicting the size of the amplification effect, and may therefore be a useful and practical tool for evaluation and intervention at the beginning of an epidemic. CONCLUSION: Concurrent partnerships may be as important as multiple partners or cofactor infections in amplifying the spread of HIV. The public health implications are that data must be collected properly to measure the levels of concurrency in a population, and that messages promoting one partner at a time are as important as messages promoting fewer partners.},

We observe a coupling between interaction strengths and the network's local structure, with the counterintuitive consequence that social networks are robust to the removal of the strong ties but fall apart after a phase transition if the weak ties are removed. We show that this coupling significantly slows the diffusion process, resulting in dynamic trapping of information in communities and find that, when it comes to information diffusion, weak and strong ties are both simultaneously ineffective.},

Using a longitudinal data set of SMO protest activity between 1960 and 1995, the authors adapt novel methods for dealing with two forms of selection and measurement bias in network analysis: (i) the mechanism that renders some SMOs more likely to select into collaboration and (ii) the notion that diffusion is an artifact of homophily or indirect learning rather than influence. The authors find that collaboration is an important channel of tactical diffusion and that SMOs with broader tactical repertoires adopt more tactics via their collaboration with other SMOs, but only up to a point. Engaging in more collaboration also makes SMOs more active transmitters and adopters of new tactics. Finally, initial overlap in respective tactical repertoires facilitates the diffusion of tactics among collaborating SMOs.},

abstract = {Competing visions of who is deserving of rewards and privileges, and different understandings of the fairness of reward allocation processes, are at the heart of political conflict. Indeed, social movement scholars generally agree that a key component of most, if not all, social movements is a shared belief that existing conditions are unfair and subject to change (Gamson 1992; McAdam 1982; Snow et al. 1986; Turner and Killian 1987). In this article we consider the role that residential segregation by education level plays in shaping perceptions of distributive justice and, in turn, providing a context conducive to conservative political mobilization. We apply these ideas in an analysis of Tea Party activism and show that educational segregation is a strong predictor of the number of Tea Party organizations in U.S. counties. In a complementary analysis, we find that individuals with a bachelor's degree are more likely than people who do not have any college education to support the Tea Party; this relationship is strongest in counties with higher levels of educational segregation.},

abstract = {Social movements are not distinct and self-contained; rather, they grow from and give birth to other perspectives, movements, work in coalition with other movements, and influence each other indirectly through their effects on the larger cultural and political environment. Building on both political process and collective identity this paper uses a case study of the women's movement's impact on U.S. peace movement activity in influence. We argue that this influence is shown by: 1) the 1980s to develop a theory of movement-movement the adoption of feminist ideological frames by the peace movement; 2) the spread of the women's movement's tactical innovations into peace protest; 3) increased presence of women in leadership positions in both the and direct action wings of the movement; and 4) the adoption of organizational struc- institutionally-oriented tures that built on feminist processes designed to avoid hierarchy. Drawing data from both movements at local and national levels, we suggest four mechanisms of transmission between the movements: I) organizational coalitions; 2) overlapping social movement communities; 3) shared personnel; and 4) broader changes in the external environment. Social movement spillover effects have implications for our understanding of both the continuity and impact of social protest movements.},

Drawing on the framing perspective in the study of social movements, we examine the development and articulation of mobilizing ideas associated with Islamic militancy and terrorist movements, ranging from the Iranian revolution of the late 1970s to more recent movements, such as al Qaeda, originating within the Middle East and Central Asia. By focusing on framing processes as key discursive mechanisms, we attempt to advance our understanding of the diverse ideological work required to facilitate the mobilization of jihadi militants as well as provide the motivation to commit sensational acts of violence such as suicide bombings.},

abstract = {This paper uses a theory of social movement outcomes, the political mediation model, to explain why certain cor- porations targeted by boycotts are more likely to concede to boycotters’ demands. Hypotheses developed from this model predict that boycotts threaten tangible and intangi- ble resources held by corporate targets, that these threats are transmitted indirectly through media coverage of the boycotts, that past declines in sales or reputation create opportunities for a movement to have influence, and that the level of threat posed by a boycott generates more influence when targeted against corporations that recent- ly experienced declines in sales or reputation. Results from analyses of a sample of corporate boycotts reported in major national newspapers in the U.S. between 1990 and 2005 provide support for the political mediation model. Corporate targets of boycotts were more likely to concede when the boycott received a great deal of media attention. The effect of media attention was amplified when the corporate target previously experienced a decline in its reputation.},

@article{steensland_2008,
abstract = {One shortcoming in the literature on policy framing has been the absence of analytic models through which to explicate change. This paper advances research in this area in three related ways. First, it links policy frames to the actors who employ them. Second, based upon this linkage it proposes two complementary approaches for examining longitudinal change in policy framing: an actor representation approach and a frame adoption approach. Third, it assesses the relative contribution of each process using demographic decomposition analysis. This analytic framework is illustrated using the case of debates over welfare reform in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s. The findings are consistent with expectations from the frame adoption approach, suggesting that ideational diffusion was largely responsible for changing discourse during this period. How do the terms of debate in public discourse become established? How do they change? The answers to these questions bear on a long line of inquiry into the role of ideas in politics, the definition of social problems and their solutions, and the nature of political influence and power (Bachrach and Baratz 1962; Edelman 1964; Lukes 1974; Schattschneider 1960). Recently, some of the most fruitful work pertaining to these questions has examined how policy issues are framed in the media. Media discourse constitutes a primary source of " common knowledge " available to average citizens on policy issues and it can exert a substantial influence on citizens' political preferences (Gamson 1992; Neuman et al. 1992; Zaller 1992). The objective of this article is to advance research on political discourse by outlining a conceptual and methodological approach to examining longitudinal change in policy framing. I illustrate this framework by using the case of debates over welfare reform in the United States during the 1960s and 1970s.},

As levels of criminal punishment have risen in the United States, however, an ever-larger number of citizens have lost the right to vote. The authors ask whether felon disenfranchisement constitutes a meaningful reversal of the extension of voting rights by considering its political impact. Data from legal sources, election studies, and inmate surveys are examined to consider two counterfactual conditions: (1) whether removing disenfranchisement restrictions alters the outcomes of past U.S. Senate and presidential elections, and (2) whether applying contemporary rates of disenfranchisement to prior elections affects their outcomes. Because felons are drawn disproportionately from the ranks of racial minorities and the poor, disenfranchisement laws tend to take more votes from Democratic than from Republican candidates. Analysis shows that felon disenfranchisement played a decisive role in U.S. Senate elections in recent years. Moreover, at least one Republican presidential victory would have been reversed if former felons had been allowed to vote, and at least one Democratic presidential victory would have been jeopardized had contemporary rates of disenfranchisement prevailed during that time.},

abstract = {Staging events with a large number of participants is a central means by which collective action movements exercise power. Creating broad coalitions that cut across movement boundaries is one way to mobilize these large numbers. In spite of this fact, most studies of social movement coalitions focus on individual movements, analyzing them in isolation. This article explores the conditions under which organizations form alliances across movement boundaries, and examines whether these cross-movement coalition events are facilitated by the same factors that inspire coalition activity among organizations active within a single movement. I use event history methods to analyze data on 2,644 left-wing protest events that occurred on college campuses between 1930 and 1990. I nd several differences between the factors that facilitate cross-movement and within-movement coalition events. The availability of resources is important to within-movement coalition events but not to cross-movement coalition formation. Local threats inspire within-movement coalition events, while larger threats that affect multiple constituencies or broadly de ned identities inspire crossmovement coalition formation. The activity of multi-issue movement organizations is associated with higher levels of all forms of protest, including single and cross-movement coalition events. This research contributes to social movement theory by demonstrating that political threats sometimes inspire protest, and that organizational goals in uence strategic action.},

This essay attempts to draw out some of the differences between the structuralist and the individualist perspectives and to offer a criticism of the individualist position.

Content, historical, and network analyses of public debates on how to organize four lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Washington marches provide evidence for an integrative position. Rather than just describe consistencies or contradictions, we contend that the key analytic challenge is to explain the organization of differences. We propose one way of doing this using the mechanism of a cultural anchor. Within and across marches, a small collection of ideas remains fixed in the national conversation, yet in a way that allows activists to address their internal diversity and respond to unfolding historical events. These results suggest that activists do not simply organize around their similarities but, through cultural anchors, they use their commonalities to build a thinly coherent foundation that can also support their differences. Situated at the nexus of culture, social movements, sexualities, and networks, this article demonstrates how the anchoring mechanism works in the context of LGBT political organizing.},

@article{seawright_2005,
abstract = {Discussions of Charles C. Ragin's Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) have not adequately considered the assumptions about causation on which this method depends. Yet in evaluating any method, it is important to ask the question: How many untestable, or hard-to-test, assumptions must be met for us to believe the find- ings it produces? Advocates of QCA claim that one of its major strengths is that it requires fewer restrictive assumptions than techniques such as regression analysis. Hence, close assessment of the assumptions that are entailed is particularly salient to evaluating QCA. This article addresses these issues by considering three of the most important kinds of assumptions discussed in the context of regression analy- sis: assumptions about the correct form of the relationship, missing variables, and inferring causation from association. For each assumption, the role of correspond- ing assumptions in QCA will be explored and illustrated through an analysis of left- party electoral fortunes in Latin America. Regarding the correct form of causal relationships, QCA in effect builds highly demanding assumptions into measure- ment procedures. Concerning missing variables, whereas earlier versions of QCA require a strong assumption of no causally relevant missing variables, more recent procedures allow some kinds of missing variables, but build in mutually contradic- tory statistical assumptions about those variables. Resolving these contradictions essentially converts QCA into all application of regression analysis. Regarding the process of inferring causation from association, QCA makes causal inference on the basis of patterns of association purely by assumption. That is, association is as- sumed to have a one-to-one relationship with causation. For all three groups of as- sumptions, QCA is found to require assumptions that are at least as restrictive as those employed in regression analysis.},

abstract = {Ethnic competition theory provides considerable insight into the localized contexts within which ethnic solidarities intensify and contribute to increased conflict, but gives less guidance as to how the spatial dynamics of such contexts impact the rise of sustained ethnic mobilization. Using the case of the Civil Rights–era Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina, the authors show that threat/competition dynamics were tied to distinct dimensions of spatial context and then root these spatial effects in social processes. Specifically, the authors demonstrate that mobilization was facilitated by the presence of opportunities for connections within and across counties, through which information about the klan could spread to other aggrieved individuals. These findings suggest that more attention be paid to the mesolevel contexts within which reactive political contention emerges.},

abstract = {This paper conceives of residential segregation as a multidimensional phenomenon varying along five distinct axes of measurement: evenness, exposure, concentration, centralization, and clustering. Twenty indices of segregation are surveyed and related conceptually to one of the five dimensions. Using data from a large set of U.S. metropolitan areas, the indices are intercorrelated and factor analyzed. Orthogonal and oblique rotations produce pattern matrices consistent with the postulated dimensional structure. Based on the factor analyses and other information, one index was chosen to represent each of the five dimensions, and these selections were confirmed with a principal components analysis. The paper recommends adopting these indices as standard indicators in future studies of segregation.},

This paper demonstrates, however, that fsQCA is an extraordinarily sensitive method whose results are worryingly susceptible to minor parametric and model specification changes. We make two specific claims. First, the essential prime implicants identified by fsQCA as being sufficient for an outcome to occur are highly contingent upon the values of several key parameters selected by the user. Second, fsQCA results are subject to marked confirmation bias. Given its tendency towards finding complex connections between variables, the method is highly likely to identify causal combinations containing even randomly generated variables as sufficient for an outcome. To illustrate these arguments, we replicate several articles utilizing fsQCA and conduct a set of sensitivity analyses and Monte Carlo simulations to assess the impact of small changes in parameter values and model specifications on the essential prime implicants.},

abstract = {This analysis extends theoretical models of ethnic boundary formation to account for the shifting and layered nature of ethnic boundaries. It focuses on the underlying structural conditions that facilitate the expansion of ethnic boundaries or the construction of a pan-national identity, and explores how organizing along an ethnic boundary affects collective efforts at the panethnic level. Two processes could be occurring: (1) Competition with other ethnic or racial groups could lead groups with different national origins to engage in collective action based on a pan-national boundary, or (2) occupational segregation could foster pan-national interests and networks that lead groups to participate in pan-national collective action. Using a new longitudinal data set of collective action events involving Asian Americans, the analyses indicate that the segregation of Asians as a group raises the frequency of pan-national collective action, while the segregation among Asian subgroups depresses the rate of pan-Asian collective action. The results also show that intra-group competition discourages pan-Asian collective action, and organizing along ethnic lines generally facilitates it. Overall, these findings are consistent with the cultural division of labor theory, which suggests that segregation processes influence panethnic collective action due to intra group interaction, common economic interests, and membership in a community of fate.

abstract = {This article explores why movements are successful in obtaining concessions from economic actors. While social movement theorists have suggested that economic actors weigh the costliness of protests, the author considers the vulnerability of movement targets to both the cost of disruptions in routine transactions and the cost of conceding to movement demands. By addressing the magnitude of these costs and their interaction, the author derives an economic opportunity structure to predict the receptivity of economic actors to movement demands and the likely struggles among them over the decision to yield. Also, this cost‐assessment approach reveals patterns of vulnerability across economic sectors to the costs of disruptive mobilization. The author tests this analysis based on case studies of the responses of economic actors to civil rights mobilization in the 1960s in five Southern localities. These cases depict how the character of protest and variation in the configuration of business communities defined the range of movement outcomes from relatively swift accommodation to persistent resistance.

This article argues that one reason for the disparity is a gap between theory and research: theory suggests that information provided by interest organizations should strongly influence elected officials, but there is no systematic research on its impact. We examine a potentially important source of information for members of the U.S. Congress--testimony at committee hearings--to ascertain if it affects the enactment of policy proposals. The data, based on content analysis of almost 1,000 testimonies on a stratified random sample of policy proposals, describe who testifies, their arguments, and the evidence they provide. Supporters of a proposal emphasize the importance of the problem being addressed, while opponents claim the proposed policy will be ineffective and try to reframe the debate. Information--particularly information regarding policy effectiveness--does affect the likelihood that a policy proposal will be enacted.},

Therefore this article uses data from a textbook example to discuss and illustrate various robustness checks of results based on the employment of crisp-set QCA and fuzzy-set QCA. In doing so, it focuses on three issues: the calibration of raw data into set-membership values, the frequency of cases linked to the configurations, and the choice of consistency thresholds. The study emphasizes that robustness tests, using systematic procedures, should be regarded as an important, and maybe even indispensable, analytical step in configurational comparative analysis.},

Using data from multiple villages in Nang Rong, Thailand, this article documents substantial variability in network structure and shows that network structure covaries with context in meaningful ways, suggesting reciprocal effects of changes in both. Finally, it considers implications of variability in network structure, showing that social cohesion affects the likelihood of finding and interviewing former village residents.},

A competing hypothesis argues that when behaviors require social reinforcement, a network with more clustering may be more advantageous, even if the network as a whole has a larger diameter. I investigated the effects of network structure on diffusion by studying the spread of health behavior through artificially structured online communities. Individual adoption was much more likely when participants received social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the social network. The behavior spread farther and faster across clustered-lattice networks than across corresponding random networks.},

On the basis of interviews with 273 respondents, we address the effects of having children on care given to kin and nonkin; assess the effects of children's characteristics, especially age and gender, on the help mothers and fathers provide; and examine how these vary with mothers' employment. Overall, we find that the presence of children connects parents into networks of care more than it constrains them. The effects vary depending on the characteristics of the child (including age and gender) as well as characteristics of the parent (like gender and employment).},

abstract = {The article combines two strands of political process theory (op- portunity and threat) in a changing authoritarian context. Through the use of protest event, archival, and secondary sources on El Sal- vador between 1962 and 1981, the study examines the outbreak and forms of two protest waves that are generated by the temporal sequencing of political opportunity and threat environments. The specific opportunities of institutional access and competitive elec- tions motivate regime challengers to form durable civic organiza- tions. This newly available organizational infrastructure can be used to sustain reformist contention in the near term as well as be rad- icalized to launch more disruptive and violent protest campaigns when opportunities recede and the political environment transitions to one characterized by mounting threats (state-attributed economic problems, erosion of rights, and state repression).},

abstract = {In this article, the authors examine participation in protests about homelessness by an unlikely set of participants—the homeless themselves. Through an analysis of data derived from 400 structured interviews with homeless individuals in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Tucson, the authors examine why and to what extent some homeless individuals, and not others, participate in movement-sponsored protest activities. In addition, the authors assess the degree to which the factors that affect participation in this population align with previous research on participation in social movements generally. They find that certain characteristics of the homeless population reduce the importance of social ties with other homeless individuals in the recruitment process and that, contrary to what much past work would lead one to expect, homeless individuals who are less biographically available are more likely to engage in protest activity. In addition, strain, which is often not a significant predictor of engagement in other populations, is an important predictor of differential participation among the homeless. This study highlights features of the homeless population that yield somewhat different correlates of participation than found in most movement participation studies and, in turn, cautions against presuming an overall model of participation that explains the engagement of all groups in the same way.

abstract = {Social status is an important phenotypic trait that determines fitness-relevant parameters. In many mammalian societies, offspring acquire a social position at adulthood similar to that held by their mother (‘‘rank inheritance’’) and thus obtain fitness benefits associated with this status. Mothers may influence the rank of their offspring at adulthood in at least three distinct ways. Firstly, the direct genetic inheritance of maternal traits that influence resource holding potential might predispose offspring to obtain a rank similar to that held by their mother. Secondly, the prenatal maternal environment might influence offspring rank if fetal exposure to maternal androgens is related to maternal status and affects offspring competitiveness. Thirdly, maternal behavioral support, a component of the postnatal maternal environment, may help offspring dominate individuals subordinate to their mother, thereby assisting offspring to acquire a rank similar to that of their mother. Here, we simultaneously test predictions derived from these three potential maternal effects on offspring rank acquisition at adulthood, using cases of offspring adoption in the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta. We demonstrate that the rank of adopted offspring at adulthood was similar to that of their surrogate mother and that the competitive ability of offspring at adulthood was best explained by postnatal maternal behavioral support. Key words: androgens, behavioral support, genetic effects, maternal effects, spotted hyena, ‘‘rank inheritance.’’},

@article{krackhardt_and_hanson_1993,
abstract = {A glance at an organizational chart can show who's the boss and who reports to whom. But this formal chart won't reveal which people confer on technical matters or discuss office politics over lunch. Much of the real work in any company gets done through this informal organization with its complex networks of relationships that cross functions and divisions. According to consultants David Krackhardt and Jeffrey Hanson, managers can harness the true power in their companies by diagramming three types of networks: the advice network, which reveals the people to whom others turn to get work done; the trust network, which uncovers who shares delicate information; and the communication network, which shows who talks about work-related matters. Using employee questionnaires, managers can generate network maps that will get to the root of many organizational problems. When a task force in a computer company, for example, was not achieving its goals, the CEO turned to network maps to find out why. He discovered that the task force leader was central in the advice network but marginal in the trust network. Task force members did not believe he would look out for their interests, so the CEO used the trust map to find someone to share responsibility for the group. And when a bank manager saw in the network map that there was little communication between tellers and supervisors, he looked for ways to foster interaction among employees of all levels. As companies continue to flatten and rely on teams, managers must rely less on their authority and more on understanding these informal networks. Managers who can use maps to identify, leverage, and revamp informal networks will have the key to success.

abstract = {It is reasonable to suppose that individuals use the number of friends that their friends have as one basis for determining whether they, themselves, have an adequate number of friends. This article shows that, if individuals compare themselves with their friends, it is likely that most of them will feel relatively inadequate. Data on friendship drawn from James Coleman's (1961) classic study The Adolescent Society are used to illustrate the phenomenon that most people have fewer friends than their friends have. The logic under- lying the phenomenon is mathematically explored, showing that the mean number of friends of friends is always greater than the mean number of friends of individuals. Further analysis shows that the proportion of individuals who have fewer friends than the mean number of friends their own friends have is affected by the exact arrangement of friendships in a social network. This disproportion- ate experiencing of friends with many friends is related to a set of abstractly similar "class size paradoxes" that includes such diverse phenomena as the tendencies for college students to experience the mean class size as larger than it actually is and for people to experi- ence beaches and parks as more crowded than they usually are},

abstract = {Collective actors typically attempt to bring about a change in law or policy by employing discursive tactics designed to convince key political decision-makers to alter policy, yet few systematic studies of the effects of social movement framing on political outcomes exist. We theorize that the cultural context in which framing takes place moderates the success of movement framing in winning changes in policy. We examine the efforts of organized women, during roughly the first half of the twentieth century, to convince lawmakers to broaden jury laws to give women the opportunity to sit on juries. To examine the combined effect of framing and the discursive opportunities provided by hegemonic legal principles, traditional gender beliefs, gendered political opportunities, opposition framing, and wartime, we use logistic regression. The findings provide substantial evidence that framing’s influence is moderated by discursive elements in the broader context. Our results suggest that investigations of how citizen groups influence law and policy must take into account framing’s important role and the ways in which the cultural context conditions framing’s influence.},

abstract = {The watershed Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education affected activist politics on issues that extend well beyond African-American civil rights or education. The apparent success of the Court decision in spurring social change encouraged activists in other social movements to emulate the NAACP Legal Defense Fund\&apos;s litigation strategy, and to adapt organizational structures, political strategies, and rhetoric borrowed from the civil rights movement. We examine how a Supreme Court decision and its subsequent interpretation influenced the development of other social movements. Borrowing from work on social movements, we contend that the Court decision signaled judicial openness to stand up for minority points of view on questions of fundamental rights, and that the civil rights movement spilled over to affect other movements. Activists continued to respond to that signal decades after Brown, even when that signal of judicial responsiveness and openness did not reflect the real prospects for achieving influence through a litigation-based strategy.David S.

abstract = {Since the beginning of the 1980 s, historical institutionalism has emerged as one of the most influential theoretical perspectives in social policy studies. Although their work is insightful, most institutionalist scholars tend to relegate policy ideas to the back of their theoretical constructions dealing with welfare state development. The objective of this paper is to show how institutionalist scholarship can pay greater attention to ideational processes without abandoning its core assump- tions about the structuring impact of political institutions and policy legacies on welfare state development. If institutions truly influence policy-making, policy ideas matter in and beyond the agenda-setting process. Related to existing policy legacies, perceived problems mesh with policy alternatives grounded in a specific paradigm. When stressing the need to reform, and promoting new alternatives, policy entrepreneurs draw on existing ideological repertoires to frame these alternatives. The ability to successfully frame policy alternatives can become a decisive aspect of the policy process. A discussion of recent European and North American policy debates illustrates these claims.},

abstract = {Why did some social movement organization (SMO) families receive extensive media coverage? In this article, we elaborate and appraise four core arguments in the literature on movements and their consequences: disruption, resource mobilization, political partisanship, and whether a movement benefits from an enforced policy. Our fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses (fsQCA) draw on new, unique data from the New York Times across the twentieth century on more than 1,200 SMOs and 34 SMO families. At the SMO family level, coverage correlates highly with common measures of the size and disruptive activity of movements, with the labor and African American civil rights movements receiving the most coverage. Addressing why some movement families experienced daily coverage, fsQCA indicates that disruption, resource mobilization, and an enforced policy are jointly sufficient; partisanship, the standard form of "political opportunity," is not part of the solution. Our results support the main perspectives, while also suggesting that movement scholars may need to reexamine their ideas of favorable political contexts. Adapted from the source document.},

From 1750 to 1900, the most marginal colonial territories often became the region’s wealthiest countries, whereas the most central colonial territories often became the region’s poorest countries. To explain this reversal, five competing hypotheses are tested using both regression and fuzzy-set methods. The fuzzy-set analysis reaches substantively important conclusions, finding that strong liberal factions are probabilistically necessary for economic development and that dense indigenous populations are probabilistically necessary for social underdevelopment. By contrast, the regression analysis generates findings that are not meaningful. The article concludes that fuzzy-set analysis and regression analysis operate in different “causal universes” and that greater attention should be granted to the causal universe occupied by fuzzy-set analysis.},

abstract = {This article examines factors associated with social movements’ abilities to disrupt corporate targets. I identify two kinds of disruption: market disruption and mediated disruption. Market disruption deters the ability of the corporate target to effectively accrue and use market resources, while mediated disruption occurs as a tactic commu- nicates a movement’s claims about the target through third party intermediaries, like the media, thereby disrupting the target’s image and reputation. Using data on corporate boycotts in the United States from 1990 to 2005, the analyses assess the extent to which movement characteristics or target characteristics cause stock price declines of boy- cotted companies—i.e., market disruption—and the frequency of national media attention given to boycotts—i.e., mediated disruption. The analyses indicate that target characteristics matter more in shaping a boycott’s initial market disruption; however, both movement and target characteristics affect mediated disruption. Certain move- ment characteristics, like social movement organization (SMO) formality, public demonstrations, and celebrity endorsements, enable mediated disruption but have no effect on market disruption. A firm’s size makes it vulner- able to both market and mediated disruption, while slack resources help a firm avoid market disruption. A target’s reputational ranking initially buffers it from market disruption but increases its vulnerability to mediated disrup- tion. The results indicate that the two kinds of disruption are interrelated. Market disruption has a marginal effect on the intensity of subsequent media coverage and ongoing media attention accentuates further market disruption.

In the present study, fifth, sixth, eighth, and ninth graders from 1 of 3 family structures (both natural parents, mother alone, or 1 natural parent and a stepparent) were compared with respect to their susceptibility to peer pressure to engage in deviant activity. All comparisons controlled for sex, age, socioeconomic status, maternal employment, and patterns of family decision making. Youngsters living with both natural parents were less susceptible to pressure from their friends to engage in deviant behavior than youngsters living in other family structures. More important, youngsters growing up in stepfamilies--in the presence of an additional adult--were equally at risk for involvement in deviant behavior as were their peers growing up in single-parent households.},

Analysis of campus newspaper articles and letters to the editor, speeches, and organizational and personal correspondence shows the emergence of a coherent and compelling narrative of the sit-ins, in which spontaneity denoted not a lack of prior coordination but independence from adult leadership, urgency, local initiative, and action by moral imperative rather than bureaucratic planning. hJarratives of the sit-ins, told by many tellers, in more and less public settings, and in which spontaneity was a central theme, helped to constitute "student activ- ist" as a new collective identity and to make high risk activism attractive. It was the storied character of represen- tations of the sit-ins that compelled participation. This case suggests the moregeneral importance of narrative- as distinct from collective action "frames"-in accounting for mobilization that takes place before the consolida- tion of movement organizations},

METHODS: Participants were 527 adolescents in grades 9-12. Adolescents reported on their substance use (cigarette and marijuana use, heavy episodic drinking), violent behavior (weapon carrying, physical fighting), suicidality (suicidal ideation and attempts), and the health-risk behavior of their friends. RESULTS: Adolescents' substance use, violence, and suicidal behavior were related to their friends' substance use, deviance, and suicidal behaviors, respectively. Friends' prosocial behavior was negatively associated with adolescent violence and substance use. Family dysfunction, social acceptance, and depression altered the magnitude of association between peers' and adolescents' risk behavior. In cumulative risk factor models, rates of adolescent health-risk behavior increased twofold with each added risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: Results supported both additive and multiplicative models of risk. Implications for intervention and primary prevention are discussed.},

This quantitative conception of social structure is the basis for a deductive theory of the macrostructure of social associations in society. The likelihood that people engage in intergroup associations under specifiable structural conditions can bededuced from analaytic propositions about structural properties without any assumption about sociopsychological dispositions to establish intergroup associations, indeed, on the assumption that people prefer ingroup relations. Group size governs the probability of intergroup relations, a fact that has paradoxical implications for discrimination by a majority against a minority. Inequality impedes and heterogeneity promotes intergroup relations. The major structural condition that governs intergroup relations is the degree of connection of parameters. Intersecting parameters exert structural constraints to participate in intergroup relations; consolidated parameters impede them. The more differentiation of any kind penetrates into the substructures of society, the greater is the probability that extensive social relations integrate various segments in society.},

This article seeks to develop a more inclusive theoretical and analytic framework by exploring the targets of violence, something that has received little disaggregated attention. We argue that consideration of who or what is targeted during the course of an event, together with collectivity size and the conditional role it may play, offers new theoretical insight into collective violence dynamics. Our analysis draws from newspaper records on a diverse range of collectivities, from parties to rallies to riots. We find that in many contexts, collectivity size increases the likelihood of violence against some targets, notably state actors, while reducing attacks on others. These findings provide the basis for a broader discussion of why unpacking targets is so critical to understanding the dynamics of collective violence.},

Between 1994 and 1998 we annually interviewed separate samples of South Africans. Our findings suggest that people's sense of grievance has become less related to race than to class. Furthermore, we found an interplay of the two kinds of comparisons in the formation of grievances. Depending on the comparison made and on the outcome of that comparison, it appears that people find it either easy or difficult to cope with a low living standard. These assessments are further qualified by trust in and influence on government. Trust and influence make people optimistic about the future and therefore more inclined to believe that their situation will improve.},

abstract = {Time-series analysis is used to assess the relationship between antiwar protests and congressional voting on war-related roll calls during the Vietnam era. Using protest event data coded from The New York Times and counts of roll-call votes generated from congressional voting data, we test for three specific mechanisms: disruptive protest, signaling, and public opinion shift. Extreme forms of disruptive protest are hypothesized as having a direct positive effect on congressional voting. Lohmann's signaling model posits exactly the opposite relationship between protest and policy. Especially extreme protests are expected to have a negative effect on both the pace and pro-peace direction of congressional action. Conversely, large (and more mod- erate) protests are expected to have a positive effect on House and Senate voting. The final mechanism, public opinion shift, depicts the relationship as indirect, with protest encouraging public opinion change, which, in turn, encourages increasingly favorable congressional voting. The results are somewhat mixed with respect to all three mechanisms, but suggest an interesting general pattern. The most extreme or threatening forms of protest (e.g., those featuring violence by demonstrators and/or property damage) simultaneously increase pro-peace voting while depressing the overall pace of congressional action. The reverse is true for more persuasive forms of protest (e.g., large demonstrations), which appear to increase the pace of voting while depressing the likelihood of pro-peace outcomes.},
