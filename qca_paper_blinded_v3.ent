{Like
in
any
QCA
analysis,
researchers
should
take
care
to
observe
which
cases
are
being
eliminated,
and
consider
how
this
would
change
the
results
if
the
thresholds
were

macro:->In
situations
where
a
lack
of
cases
substantially
reduces
our
ability
to
solve
research
questions,
we
have
included
in
the
software
package
a
function
that
pulls
out
configurations
excluded
from
analysis
by
nature
of
trying
to
improve
robustness.
When
two
models,
say
Model
1
with
configurational
n
threshold
of
2
and
Model
2
with
configurational
threshold
of
4,
one
can
run
QCAdiff(model1,model2)
to
determine
which
configurations
were
excluded.
If
the
researcher
has
a
compelling
reason
to
reduce
the
robustness
threshold
in
favor
of
a
researcher-provided
explanation,
we
welcome
it.
